<p>Often known simply as the employment or third preference greencard, this is the standard option for anyone seeking permanent residency. To get this, the applicant must have a petitioning employer demonstrate that this person is well-paid, and that their permanent presence in the US will not come at the detriment of American labor. This option requires the least effort from the applicant, but as a result ties them to their employer for the duration of the application, which can take up to three years.</p>

<p>This option is best for professionals from country where there is no wait time to get a greencard, and who plan on staying with their current employer for at least three years.</p>

<p>Employer files a prevailing wage requestion or PWD to determine your pay/salary, based on where your job is located and the current economic environment. When the PWD is received, the company has 90 days to file. This typically takes 2–3 months.</p>

<h2 id="recruitment-step-2-of-perm-or-eta-9089">Recruitment (step 2 of PERM or ETA 9089)</h2>
<p>Employer goes through an extensive recruitment process for 90-120 days (60 days min) to prove that they can’t find a person who can fill this role. At the end of this process, they prepare a document called a recruitment report to tell the story of how this will not take away an american job. Once recruitment is complete, employer files an ETA-9089 form. If all goes well, the DOL will issue a permanent labor certification in response</p>
