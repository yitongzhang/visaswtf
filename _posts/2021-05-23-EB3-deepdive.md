# TL;DR
Often known simply as the employment or third preference greencard, this is the standard option for anyone seeking permanent residency. To get this, the applicant must have a petitioning employer demonstrate that this person is well-paid, and that their permanent presence in the US will not come at the detriment of American labor. This option requires the least effort from the applicant, but as a result ties them to their employer for the duration of the application, which can take up to three years.

This option is best for professionals from country where there is no wait time to get a greencard, and who plan on staying with their current employer for at least three years.


# Timeline
## Labour certification (step 1 of PERM or PWD)

## Recruitment (step 2 of PERM or ETA 9089)
Employer goes through an extensive recruitment process for 90-120 days (60 days min) to prove that they can't find a person who can fill this role. At the end of this process, they prepare a document called a recruitment report to tell the story of how this will not take away an american job. Once recruitment is complete, employer files an ETA-9089 form. If all goes well, the DOL will issue a permanent labor certification in response
